Architect enables any application to run continuously on spot instances with zero downtime and zero data loss during
preemption events - all without requiring code modifications. By making spot instance preemption irrelevant,
Architect unlocks immediate 75%+ infrastructure cost savings while maintaining production-grade reliability.

### Key Features

- **Zero Downtime Migration:** Continuously capture and transfer application state between compute resources within the preemption window, maintaining active network connections without interruption
- **No Code Changes Required:** Deploy existing applications on spot instances without implementing checkpoint/restore logic or other modifications
- **Complete State Preservation:** Retain all application state during migrations, including CPU, memory, and GPU state
- **Cross-Environment Compatibility:** Seamlessly move workloads between different CPU architectures, GPU types, cloud providers, and regions
- **Universal Workload Support:** Run any application on spot instances - from ML training and inference to databases, game servers, and data pipelines

### How Architect Works

Unlike traditional checkpoint-based approaches, Architect takes a fundamentally different approach to handling spot
instance preemption:

1. **Continuous State Capture:** Efficiently serialize and store application state to passive storage (EBS, S3, etc.)
2. **Preemption Detection:** Receive and respond to cloud provider preemption notices automatically
3. **Resource Acquisition:** Identify and secure target compute resources across available providers
4. **Live Migration:** Stream application state to the new instance, combining previously captured state with live changes
5. **Traffic Management:** Automatically reroute network connections without dropping active sessions

The entire process completes within the preemption window, making instance termination irrelevant to your running applications.

### Going Beyond Spot Instances

While immediate cost savings through spot instance usage is a primary benefit, Architect's capabilities extend far beyond:

- Deploy truly portable multi-cloud infrastructure
- Perform zero-downtime hardware upgrades
- Optimize geographic placement for latency
- Eliminate downtime from resource failures
- Move compute closer to users on demand
