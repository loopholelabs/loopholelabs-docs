# Design Decisions

Polyglot's design is guided by a clear set of principles that prioritize performance and simplicity over flexibility
and features. This page explains these core design decisions and their implications.

## Core Principles

### 1. Performance First
Polyglot's primary design goal is maximum performance. This manifests in several ways:

- **Zero-Copy Operations**: Where possible, Polyglot operates directly on memory buffers without requiring intermediate copies
- **Minimal Allocations**: The framework is designed to minimize memory allocations, with features like buffer reuse
- **Simple Format**: The binary format is straightforward, requiring minimal processing to encode or decode
- **Direct Mapping**: Types map directly to their binary representations without additional metadata

### 2. Simplicity Over Flexibility
Polyglot intentionally omits features common in other serialization frameworks to maintain simplicity:

- No schema versioning
- No type negotiation
- No backward/forward compatibility
- No runtime type discovery
- No optional fields

This means both ends of a Polyglot communication channel must have matching expectations about the data structure being transmitted.

### 3. Explicit Over Implicit
The framework favors explicit operations over implicit behavior:

- Explicit type specifications for collections
- Direct memory management in C
- Clear boundaries between encoding and decoding operations
- No automatic type coercion

## Key Tradeoffs

### Schema Evolution vs Performance
The most significant tradeoff in Polyglot is the decision to omit schema evolution capabilities. This means:

#### Benefits

- No version checking overhead
- No need to store schema information
- Minimal parsing required
- Smaller message sizes
- Predictable performance

#### Limitations

- Both ends must maintain matching type definitions
- No backward compatibility between versions
- Changes require coordinated updates

### Memory Management vs Convenience
Polyglot provides different memory management patterns for different languages:

- C: Explicit allocation and deallocation
- Go: Optional buffer pooling for reuse
- Rust: Leverage the ownership system
- TypeScript: Automatic memory management

This allows each language to use its natural memory management patterns while still maintaining high performance.

## Implementation Principles
The implementation follows these guidelines:

1. **Minimal Dependencies**: Each language implementation has minimal external dependencies
2. **Consistent API**: While respecting each language's idioms, the API remains conceptually consistent
3. **Predictable Performance**: Operations have consistent, predictable performance characteristics
4. **Error Handling**: Clear error handling that respects each language's conventions
5. **Buffer Management**: Efficient buffer management appropriate for each language
