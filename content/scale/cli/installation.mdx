The Scale CLI is a command line interface for interacting with the Scale API and for working with Scale Functions locally.

The CLI is written in [Golang](https://golang.org/) and is [Open Source](https://github.com/loopholelabs/scale-cli).

## Install the Scale CLI

The Scale CLI is the primary tool for interacting with Scale Functions and the Scale Registry. It can be easily installed using the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://dl.scale.sh | sh
```

<Callout type={"info"}>
    The CLI attempts to install itself to `/usr/local/bin` by default, but you can also specify a different directory by setting the `INSTALL` environment variable like so:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://dl.scale.sh | INSTALL=./ sh
    ```
</Callout>

To verify that the CLI was installed correctly, check the scale cli version by running the following command:

```bash
scale version
```

## Building from Source

To build the CLI from source, you will need to have [Go](https://golang.org/) installed. Then, you can clone the
source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/loopholelabs/scale-cli
cd scale-cli
```

<Callout type={"warn"}>
    The minimum supported version of [Go](https://golang.org/) for building the Scale CLI is **1.20**.
</Callout>

Building the CLI can be done with the following command:

```bash
cd cmd
go build -o scale .
```

This will create a binary called `scale` in the `cmd` directory. You can then move this binary to a directory in your
`PATH` to use it.

## Using the Scale CLI

Once you have the Scale CLI installed, you can use it to interact with the Scale API and to build, run, and interact with
Scale Functions locally.

Check out the [Scale CLI Reference](/scale/cli/reference) for more information on how to use the CLI.
