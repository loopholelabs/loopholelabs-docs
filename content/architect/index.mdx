Architect documentation is coming soon! 

##Introduction
Architect continuously captures the complete state of your running application - including CPU, memory, and GPU state and failure, pre-emption, or other event, it will migrate your application to different computing resources or roll back to a recent healthy state, with virtually no data loss or downtime.  It addresses the challenge of extreme low latency movement of a workload across compute at the lower layers of the stack to deliver “live” migrations.
