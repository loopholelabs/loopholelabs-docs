description: An overview of Rust support in Scale Functions
---

Scale Functions currently support using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) as a [Guest](#guest-support) language.

This means that you can write your Functions in Rust ([Guest Support](#guest-support)).

## Guest Support

A Scale Function written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) often looks something like this:

```rust title="scale.rs"
use scale_signature_http::context::Context;

pub fn scale(ctx: &mut Context) -> Result<&mut Context, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    ctx.response().set_body("Hello, World!".to_string());
    Ok(ctx)
}
```

The above example is a simple HTTP Function that responds with "Hello, World!" to any request.

By default, the generated function will be configured to use the `HTTP Signature`,
which provides an interface for handling HTTP requests and responses. To learn more about the `HTTP Signature` and the
interfaces it provides, you can check out the [HTTP Signature Reference](/scale/signatures/http). Learn more about Signatures in the [Signatures Overview](/scale/signatures/overview).

Compiling these Functions requires the appropriate toolchain to be installed on your machine.

### Installing the Rust Toolchain

To use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) as the Guest Language, you'll need to install the following:
- The [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) toolchain
- The [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) package manager
- The [wasm32-unknown-unknown](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#platform-specific-dependencies) build target

The best way to install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) is to follow the official instructions for
your operating system and platform at [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

In general, you'll want to install the `rustup` tool, which will allow you to easily install and manage multiple
versions of Rust on your machine. This can be done by running the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

You can verify that Rust was installed correctly by running the following command:

```bash
rustc --version
```

<Callout>
    The minimum supported version of Rust for use with Scale Functions is `1.67.0`.
</Callout>

You can verify that Cargo was installed correctly by running the following command:

```bash
cargo --version
```

<Callout>
    The minimum supported version of Cargo for use with Scale Functions is `1.67.0`.
</Callout>

Next, you'll need to install the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` build target. This can be done by running the following
command:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

You can verify that the build target was installed correctly by running the following command and verifying that
`wasm32-unknown-unknown` is listed in the output:

```bash
rustup target list --installed
```
